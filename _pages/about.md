I'm a first year Master candidate in Economics from [Graduate School of Arts and Science](https://gsas.nyu.edu/), [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Spencer Lyon](https://sglyon.github.io/) in the Machine Learning course from Graduate School of Arts and Science, New York University. I was advised by [Prof. Yuchao Peng](https://sf.cufe.edu.cn/info/1112/13539.htm) from [School of Finance](https://sf.cufe.edu.cn/), [Central University of Finance and Economics](https://www.cufe.edu.cn/index.htm).

You can find my CV here: [Yuanzhi (Stella) Ma's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

From the original repository forked: How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
